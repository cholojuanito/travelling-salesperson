        Time: O(n^2 B^n) where "n" is the number of cities and "B" is
            the "branching factor". The branching factor is a number
            that is calculated for each state. It is dependent on many
            factors including: 
                1) Depth in the search tree
                2) The number of cities that can be reached from that state

            The n in the exponent comes from the number of possible
            states that can be produced at that particular state. 

            The n^2 comes from the amount of work done while creating
            each state. At each state, a cost matrix is made and then
            reduced to obtain the bound for the state. This involves
            iterating over an 'n by n' 2-D array, thus giving us n^2 operations.

        Space: O(n2 E B) â€“ where n is the number of  cities, E is the number of edges between the cities at a particular state and B is the branch factor mentioned above.
            The n2 represents the 2-D cost matrix that each state contains.
            The E represents the number of possible outward edges at any given state.
            This encompasses the size and amount of the states that could possibly be created.

        The Branch and Bound algorithm for solving the travelling 
        salesperson problem.
        This algorithm uses SearchState objects to represent a node
        in the search tree. The search tree is implemented using a 
        a min-heap.

        ## The Algorithm ##
        The basic idea is that we start with an initial state and 
        create/expand into child states from there. If at any point
        a child state contains a better solution than the current 
        bssf (best solution so far) we then update the bssf and now
        compare each child state that is made or state from the heap
        with the bssf. The bssf is intialized to a random permutation.
         If a state's bound is greater than the bssf's cost
        then we "prune" it from the search tree. Since logically it would
        be a waste of time to keep searching that branch.

        ## The Heap ##
        The heap used is a min-heap. It is implemented using the heapq
        module. It sorts the heap based on the bound of each state.
        The state with the lowest bound will always be the first element
        in the heap
